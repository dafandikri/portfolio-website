    "description": "Leg flexibility and tricep strength was needed to start because there was no footholds for the starting move. After that, we need to traverse rightwards, before making a big move to the top hold using deadpoint, which is kind of scary because it looks far away to reach and your feet could slip off if you don't flag properly.",

      "Got encouragement from strangers while climbing",
      "Switched feet smoothly on the traverse",
      "Flagged well to stabilize while reaching the top hold"
